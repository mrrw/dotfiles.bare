# TODO list for marrow.  
#
# Arch.  I live in the fucking shell.  So, lets make the shell awesome.
#
# Step 1:  Choose/Customize a terminal emulator.
#     - Currently using xterm and/or urxvt
#     - increase cursor blink rate
# Step 2:  Customize zsh.
#    I'll be living in zsh, so I want to tweak functionality:
#     - tell me what vim mode it's in;
#     - tell me what git repository it's in;
#     - tweak autocomplete;
#     - colorize syntax, etc;
#     - pamper me in any way possible.  Zsh is my only friend. 
# Step 3:  Tweak vim.
#     - Colorize more syntax
#     - change cursor shape, like zsh
#     - increase cursor blink rate
# Step 4:  Customize xmonad
#     - use "startupHook" to start programs w/ xmonad (or use .xinitrc)
#     - use "manageHook" to assign programs to different workstations

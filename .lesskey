#-- Keybinding config for less/man.
#-- Commands specified by lesskey take precedence over
#   the default commands.
#-- A key may be defined to do nothing by using the
#   action "noaction".
#-- In addition, ALL default commands may be disabled
#   by adding this control line to the input file:
#   #stop
#   This will cause all default commands to be ignored.
#   The #stop line should be the last line in that
#   section of the file.
